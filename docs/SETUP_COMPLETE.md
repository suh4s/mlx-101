### 🔧 Environment Status
- **Virtual Environment**: `mlx-env` ✅ Active & Isolated
- **Python**: 3.9.6 (native Apple Silicon) ✅ 
- **MLX**: 0.26.1 ✅ Working perfectly
- **Swift**: 6.1.2 ✅ Apple Silicon ready
- **Package Manager**: `uv` ✅ Fast dependency management
- **Additional packages**: numpy, matplotlib, jupyter, pillow ✅

## 🚀 How to Use Your Environment

### Daily Workflow
```bash
# 1. Activate environment (start every session)
source mlx-env/bin/activate

# 2. Run examples
python examples/01_basic_operations.py
python mlx_demo.py

# 3. Start Jupyter for experimentation
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook

# 4. When done
deactivate
```

### Installing New Packages
```bash
# Install with uv (faster than pip)
uv pip install package_name

# Update requirements.txt after installing
uv pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## 📚 Learning Path

### 1. Start with Python Examples ✅
- **`01_basic_operations.py`** - Array creation, math, NumPy interop
- **`03_neural_networks.py`** - Neural networks, training loops
- **`mlx_demo.py`** - Quick overview of all capabilities

### 2. Advanced Topics (Ready to Explore)
- **Linear Algebra**: Matrix operations, decompositions, solving systems
- **Image Processing**: Convolutions, transformations, computer vision
- **Deep Learning**: CNNs, RNNs, transformers with MLX

### 3. Swift Integration
- Explore `swift-examples/` directory
- Build with Swift Package Manager
- Combine Swift performance with MLX power

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (You can do now):
1. **Run the working examples**: Start with `python mlx_demo.py`
2. **Experiment in Jupyter**: `jupyter lab` for interactive development
3. **Modify examples**: Change the code and see what happens!

### Short-term:
1. **Build Swift examples**: `cd swift-examples && swift build`
