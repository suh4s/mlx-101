## About MLX
MLX is an array framework for machine learning research on Apple Silicon. It's designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and flexible, with a Python API that closely follows NumPy and a C++ API. MLX is particularly optimized for Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3+ chips) and provides unified memory that allows arrays to live in shared memory accessible to both CPU and GPU.

## System Requirements
- **Hardware**: Apple Silicon Mac (M1, M2, M3+)
- **OS**: macOS 13.5+ (macOS 14+ recommended)
- **Python**: 3.9+ (native arm64, not x86 via Rosetta)
- **Swift**: 5.7+ (for Swift examples)

### üî¨ Key Discoveries & Fixes Made

During the development of this repository, we encountered and solved several important MLX compatibility issues:

#### **üîß GPU/CPU Stream Issues**
- **Problem**: Some linear algebra operations (`mx.linalg.inv`, `mx.linalg.qr`, `mx.linalg.solve`) not yet supported on GPU
- **Solution**: Use CPU streams with proper evaluation: `with mx.stream(mx.cpu): result = operation(); mx.eval(result)`
- **Impact**: All linear algebra examples now work reliably across MLX versions

#### **üìù Array Assignment Limitations** 
- **Problem**: MLX's `.at[].set()` method causing `'ArrayAt' object has no attribute 'set'` errors
- **Solution**: Hybrid approach using NumPy for complex assignments, converting back to MLX
- **Impact**: Image processing operations like max pooling and resizing now work perfectly

#### **üîÑ Missing Operations**
- **Problem**: Operations like `mx.rot90()` don't exist in current MLX versions
- **Solution**: Use NumPy equivalents and convert: `mx.array(np.rot90(np.array(mlx_array)))`
- **Impact**: All image transformation examples work seamlessly

#### **‚ö° Performance Optimizations Discovered**
- **Unified Memory**: True zero-copy between CPU and GPU operations
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Operations are automatically fused for better performance
- **Broadcasting**: MLX's broadcasting rules closely follow NumPy for familiar behavior
- **Vectorization**: Always prefer vectorized operations over Python loops

### üéì Critical Insights Discovered

#### **‚ö° Performance Insights**
```python
# ‚úÖ MLX Strengths: Fast unified memory operations
result = mlx_array @ other_array  # GPU-accelerated, no memory transfers

# ‚ö†Ô∏è MLX Limitations: Some linalg ops need CPU streams
with mx.stream(mx.cpu):
    inv_matrix = mx.linalg.inv(matrix)  # Fallback to CPU when needed
```

#### **üîÑ Compatibility Patterns**
```python
# ‚úÖ Hybrid MLX-NumPy approach for complex operations
mlx_data = mx.array(input_data)      # Use MLX for computation
numpy_data = np.array(mlx_data)      # Convert for complex assignments
result = mx.array(processed_numpy)   # Back to MLX for further processing
```

#### **üßÆ Development Workflow**
1. **Start Simple**: Use `working_examples.py` for guaranteed-working patterns
2. **Understand Limitations**: Know when to use CPU streams vs GPU
3. **Leverage Strengths**: Use MLX for heavy computation, NumPy for complex indexing
4. **Test Incrementally**: Build up from basic operations to complex models

### üîë Essential Patterns You've Mastered

#### **üéØ Robust MLX Code**
```python
# Always handle GPU/CPU compatibility
try:
    result = mx.linalg.solve(A, b)  # Try GPU first
except:
    with mx.stream(mx.cpu):         # Fallback to CPU
        result = mx.linalg.solve(A, b)
        mx.eval(result)
```

#### **üìä Efficient Data Processing**
```python
# Leverage broadcasting and vectorization
processed = (data - mean) / std     # Vectorized normalization
result = mx.sum(processed * weights, axis=1)  # Efficient reductions
```

#### **üß† Neural Network Building**
```python
# Clean, extensible neural network patterns
def layer_forward(x, weights, bias):
    return mx.maximum(0, x @ weights + bias)  # ReLU activation

# Gradient-ready operations
loss = mx.mean((predictions - targets) ** 2)  # MSE loss
```
